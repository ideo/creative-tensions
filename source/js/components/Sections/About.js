						<p><i>Creative Tensions</i> is not a  panel; it's a conversation that moves. Reflecting on a tension between two poles, participants reveal where they stand on an issue by where they stand&mdash;and move&mdash;in the room. Exploring topics that lie at the heart of what it means to be human, <i>Creative Tensions</i> is a fresh approach to group dialogue that encourages openness and inspires empathy.</p>
